<p> People with kids (or if you like drawing), need your help. I am giving an Ignite talk (five minutes, 15 slides) at the Ecological Society of America conference next week and I want to use drawings from kids. Kind of last minute, I know, but I don't really like the other stuff I have and I thought this we be far more interesting. The session is based on the "Thing Explainer" book by Randall Monroe with the idea being to communicate science using only the 1000 most common words. If you can, could you have your kid or some random kid make some drawings and then you send me a picture of that drawing? Today if you can, tomorrow is good too. I will give your kid credit (unless you prefer not as the talk will be recorded and go on the Internet). Any medium is OK. Here are the things I need pictures of: </p>

<ul>
<li>forest</li>
<li>desert</li>
<li>prairie or grassland or meadow</li>
<li>coastline (like a beach scene, needs sand and grass or shrubs)</li>
<li>mountains</li>
<li>factories with land around them</li>
<li>farming</li>
<li>logging/forestry/lumberjack</li>
<li>rain clouds and rain</li>
<li>snow</li>
<li>extreme events like a flood, hurricane, or tornado</li>
<li>clock</li>
<li>city</li>
<li>shrubs/small trees</li>
</ul>

<p>Also anything you want to just throw in will be considered. I appreciate the help. I think this will be far more interesting than a boring talk with figures. The title of my talk is "Where you are on the land matters . . . except when it doesn't" with the big ideas being that 1) every ecosystem doesn't function like every other ecosystem (a forest is a forest, but sometimes every forest isn't like every other forest, nor is every place in that forest like every other place); 2) it is necessary to consider individual histories and trajectories of any place.
Also if you are an adult with crayons and want to draw something, do it.
Thanks for your consideration. You can email me pictures at: <a href="mailto:jeffatkins81@gmail.com">jeffatkins81@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:jwa5cz@virginia.edu">jwa5cz@virginia.edu</a>

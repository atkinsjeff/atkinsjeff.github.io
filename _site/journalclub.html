		<p>The proposal . . . an online journal club focused on recent papers in terrestrial ecology. </p>
		
		<p> A litany of ideas for discussion: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li> The first rule of journal club is you are free to talk about journal club and invite whoever you want to journal club</li>
			<li> I have been using <a href = https://slack.com/ style="color:red"> Slack </a> for an NSF RCN and for planning podcast stuff and I think it is a great platform for a journal club. 
			Slack lets you have a "channel" for your team where you can have a conversation--you can add files in and anyone on your team can have access. I also like that
			you can control your level of interaction. You can have it on your phone and have it constantly update you when people post, or you can login whenever you want. 
			You get to decide how you want to do things. Also, the conversation is logged and it has hashtags and you can keep up with everything. Totally open to other ideas though. </li>
			<li> To me, Slack threads the needle of being a platform that is accessible to most everyone (it's free for the first 1 million messages? Something like that), where you can set
			it so that you aren't constantly deluged in the way an incessant reply all email chain can be. It also isn't as clunky as a Twitter conversation or hashtag. </li>
			<li> I am thinking one article a week?</li>
			<li> Discussion could occur during the course of the week on the article, more free form than an appointed time. I think engaged people would organically create the discussion. 
			Similar to message boards back in the day (those are maybe still a thing?) </li>
			<li> Did you know there is a Wikipedia entry for <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_club style="color:red"> Journal Club </a>? </li>
			<li> We could make a Twitter handle for this stuff too, I mean we should, right? </li>
			<li> Maybe focus on articles from the last year.</li>
			<li> Everyone could rotate picking articles like a book club. </li>
			<li> We could concurrently run a historical ecology journal club as another Slack channel where we talk about an oldie, but a goodie each week. </li>

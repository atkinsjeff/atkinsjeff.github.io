        <p><h3>Carbon and Water Cycling in Topographically-Complex Watersheds</h3>
       
        <p>In topographically complex watersheds, landscape position and vegetation heterogeneity can alter the movements of energy 
        through the lateral and vertical redistribution of soil water, thus affecting biogeochemical cycles. In the Weimer Run 
        watershed in West Virginia, a 374 ha watershed in the Allegheny Mountains, we established a plot-based study across 
        an elevation and vegetation gradient. Within our watershed, Rhododendron and other understory, evergreen shrubs exert strong controls on 
        soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux, soil temperatures, and soil moisture--an effect exacerbated during years of below average precipitation. 
        Rhododendron also influence soil physical and chemical properties,. and decomposition--both through direct and indirect controls.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="blandy_project.html">Methane and Carbon Dioxide Fluxes From Ephemeral Wetland Transition Zones</a></h3>

        <p>Ephemeral wetlands and vernal pools comprise a significant portion of inland wetlands, especially in the state of
            Virginia, home to nearly 750,000 acres of non-tidal wetlands. The annual expansion and contraction of
             wetlands results in dynamic changes in the surrounding soils--where the soil environment alternates between states
             where either aerobic or anaerobic respiration may dominate based on soil moisture. The dynamics controlling the switch between states of aerobic and anaerobic conditions
            are not well conceptualized, especially in the mid-Atlantic. Lake Arnold, an ephemeral wetland
            located at the Blandy Experimental Farm offers an excellent site to evaluate these dynamics.

        <h3>Red Spruce Restoration Dynamics in the Central Appalachians</h3>

        <p>Red spruce is a former canopy dominant of the Appalachians, once covering over 500,000 acres in West Virginia alone. 
        Logging and disturbance in the late 1800's and early 1900's has reduced current red spruce coverage to below 
        30,000 acres in the state. Red spruce forests offer habitat for threatened and endangered species like the 
        northern flying squirrel and cheat river salamander.

        Our work, in cooperation the researchers at West Virginia University, focuses on modelling future suitability for red 
        spruce at the regional to watershed scale using prior information from soil mapping surveys of podozolization 
        and down-scaled climate modelling projections. </p>

        <h3>Shenandoah Watershed Study (SWAS)</h3>
        <p>I also work with the SWAS group, a research group at UVA focusing on biogeochemistry of
        headwater mountain streams in the mid-Atlantic.
        I do weekly water sampling and station upkeep. During 2013 and 2014 I was able to participate
        in re-instrumenting the three main SWAS sites and in the process became well-acquainted with Campbell data loggers,
        Campbell programming, and hydrological instrumentation. </p>

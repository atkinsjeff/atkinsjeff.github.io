		<p>
		I came to you one rainless August night. <br>
You taught me how to live without the rain. <br>
You are thirst and thirst is all I know.<br>
You are sand, wind, sun, and burning sky,<br>
The hottest blue. You blow a breeze and brand<br>
Your breath into my mouth. You reach—then bend<br>
Your force, to break, blow, burn, and make me new.<br>
You wrap your name tight around my ribs<br>
And keep me warm. I was born for you.<br>
Above, below, by you, by you surrounded.<br>
I wake to you at dawn. Never break your<br>
Knot. Reach, rise, blow, Sálvame, mi dios,<br>
Trágame, mi tierra. Salva, traga, Break me,<br>
I am bread. I will be the water for your thirst.<br>

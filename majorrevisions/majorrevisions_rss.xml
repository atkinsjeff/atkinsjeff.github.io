      <itunes:summary>Grace, Jon, and Jeff talk about recent op-eds in Nature and Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment on the culture of science and ecology in particular. How do we build strong lab culture? How do we think about and do science in the 21st Century? Is the underlying culture of science at risk? Also, Jeff's car was eaten by rats and we talk MDPI journals and how you can publish multiple OA articles for free, if they are well-prepared.</itunes:summary>

I am a Research Biologist with the [USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station](https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/staff/scientists/1113). My research focuses on 1) forest structure and structural diversity relationships to growth, nutrient cycling, animal habitat, and climate change response; 2) The spatiotemporal evolution of forest structure and diversity as a function of disturbance mechanismsâ€”specifically focusing on moderate severity disturbance and co-occurring disturbances; 3) Development and application of novel remote sensing techniques in ecology and forestry (e.g. terrestrial laser scanning, UAVs, hyperspectral, RGB imagery) to measure forest structure (e.g. structural complexity, stand structure); 4) forest microclimates, including leading the development of ForestMicroNet, a USDA funded project to build a forest microclimate network for the southern US.

I co-host the ecology and science podcast [Major Revisions](http://www.majorrevisionsshow.com)

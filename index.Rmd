I am an ecosystem ecologist and postdoctoral fellow at Virginia Commonwealth University where I work with [Dr. Chris Gough](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~cmgough/) and the [Gough Lab](https://twitter.com/gough_lab). My research focuses on exploring the relationships between ecosystem structure and function. Specifically, I use remote sensing techniques including terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging) to examine how we can more fully characterize the structure of ecosystems to better understand ecosystem function (e.g. productivity, resource  efficiencies, response to disturbance).

I co-host the ecology and science podcast [Major Revisions](http://www.majorrevisionsshow.com)
